# R-FTSE-100-Monthly-Trend-Analysis
R Project for FTSE 100 Monthly trend from 2000-2025.
FTSE 100 Monthly Seasonality Analysis (R Version)
📈 Project Overview
This project replicates the FTSE 100 monthly trend analysis using R and the tidyverse. It investigates the historical performance of the index to determine if there are any discernible seasonal trends—specifically, whether certain months of the year have historically provided better or worse returns on average.

Author: Ash

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
R: The programming language used for the analysis.

Tidyverse: A collection of R packages designed for data science, including:

readr for data loading.

dplyr for data manipulation.

lubridate for easy date handling.

ggplot2 for creating high-quality data visualizations.

pacman: For cleanly loading and installing packages.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Prerequisites: Make sure you have R and RStudio (or VS Code with the R extension) installed.

Run the analysis script: Execute the R script from your R console or RStudio.

source('monthly_trend_analysis.R')

The script will automatically install any missing packages, print a statistical summary to your console, and generate two new plots:

ftse_100_monthly_distribution_r.png: Shows the spread of returns for each month.

ftse_100_average_monthly_return_r.png: A bar chart of the average monthly returns.

📊 Results and Visualizations
(The interpretation of the plots is the same as in the Python version. You can insert the new R-generated PNGs here after running the script.)

📜 Conclusion & Disclaimer
The analysis of the FTSE 100 data from 2000-2025 reveals some slight historical tendencies for certain months to outperform others on average.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This analysis is purely descriptive and based on historical data. Past performance is not a guarantee or reliable indicator of future results. Financial markets are influenced by countless unpredictable factors, and these historical averages are not strong enough to form the basis of a profitable investment strategy.
