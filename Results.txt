Results: Analysis of FTSE 100 Monthly Returns (2000-2025)
Figure 1 presents a box plot analysis illustrating the distribution of monthly percentage returns for the FTSE 100 index over the period from January 2000 to September 2025. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in central tendency, dispersion, and seasonality, providing insights into the historical behaviour of the UK's leading stock market index. It is important to note that as of the time of writing (September 2025), the data for the final year in the period is partial.
1. General Market Trend:
A primary observation across the entire period is a positive skew in monthly returns. The median monthly return is positive for ten out of the twelve months, suggesting a general long-term upward trend in the index. Despite this positive tendency, the presence of significant interquartile ranges (IQRs) and extensive whiskers in all months indicates that considerable volatility and risk are inherent features of the market.
2. Key Seasonal Patterns:
Clear seasonal effects are observable when comparing monthly distributions:
 * Strongest Performance: April stands out as the most consistently strong month. Its entire interquartile range is situated above the 0% return line, signifying that in 75% of the years observed, April yielded a positive return. The fourth quarter, particularly November and December, also demonstrates robust performance with high median returns and a strong positive distribution, which aligns with the widely-documented "Santa Claus Rally" phenomenon.
 * Weakest Performance: Conversely, September exhibits the most pronounced historical weakness. It features one of the lowest median returns and a notable negative skew, evidenced by its long lower whisker and several negative outliers. This empirical result supports the market anomaly often referred to as the "September Effect." June also displays a tendency towards weaker performance, with a median return close to zero.
3. Volatility and Risk Analysis:
Volatility, measured by the height of the boxes and the range of the whiskers, is not uniform throughout the year. The autumn months, September and October, display the greatest range and a higher propensity for negative returns. The elongated lower whiskers during this period suggest that while positive returns are possible, the risk of sharp, significant market declines has historically been greater than in other months. In contrast, months like August show a more constrained IQR, suggesting periods of relatively lower volatility.
4. Outlier Events:
The plot identifies numerous outliers, represented by individual data points, which correspond to months of extreme market performance. These negative and positive outliers are likely correlated with major socio-economic events, such as the dot-com bubble aftermath, the 2008 global financial crisis, the Brexit referendum, and the severe market disruption and subsequent recovery phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Summary of Findings:
In summary, the analysis of FTSE 100 monthly returns from 2000-2025 reveals a market with a general tendency for positive growth but one that is subject to distinct seasonal patterns. The data provides strong evidence for historically favourable performance in April and the fourth quarter, and notable weakness in September. Furthermore, the persistent volatility and presence of extreme outliers across all months underscore the inherent risks of the equity market.
